#### ❓ QUESTION #1:

Why do we want to support streaming? What about streaming is important, or useful?

#### ❓ ANSWER #1:

Users sessions are used to keep track of users activity. It can be used to retrieve contxt from previous conversations or separate conversions

#### ❓ Discussion Question #1:

Upload a PDF file of the recent DeepSeek-R1 paper and ask the following questions:
